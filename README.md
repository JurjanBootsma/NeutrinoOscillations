## Project by Jurjan Bootsma

## Description
This is a project done by the bachelor student Jurjan Bootsma. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks about a few different topics and they are inside different directories. A few notebooks contain interactive elements and with those notebooks, GIFs are added to give an idea of how this looks. Under this the different parts of the project are explained. 

## Oscillations and Detector Response
In this directory, a notebook can be found to give an intuitive understanding of the neutrino oscillation parameters. It shows the oscillation probability as a function of the energy and the cosine of theta. This is based on joscprob from Jpp. Furthermore, there is a notebook on creating all kinds of detector response images.

## Event Displays
In this directory, there are 3 notebooks with interactive event generators. The first looks at all the momenta involved in an interaction. The second looks at a polar plot of the transverse momenta of three flavours at once. The last one looks how the hits distribute themselves as a function of time.

## Nuclear Effects
In this directory, notebooks can be found to analyse some nuclear effects in the neutrino simulations data. The first one focuses on how to perform a Lorentz boost and why that does not work every time. The second is about the cross section as a function of energy. The third is about the differential cross section as a function of energy, bjorken-x and bjorken-y. The last one is about the EMC effect.

## Authors and acknowledgment
These notebooks are written by Jurjan Bootsma with supervising from Bouke Jung and Maarten de Jong.
